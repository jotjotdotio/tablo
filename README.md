# The Tablo File Format

__Tablo__ is a plain text interchange format for tabular data. It is more
powerful than CSV while remaining easy for people to read and write.

It adds explicit headers, datatypes, and cell formatting to address
shortcomings of delimiter-separated formats like CSV or TSV. __Tablo__ solves
delimiter collision issues by having well-defined quoting and escaping rules
that are familiar to users of formats like JSON or common programming languages
like Python or JavaScript.
